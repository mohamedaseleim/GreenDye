## Test Statistics

### Coverage
- **Models**: 3 test files
- **Integration**: 3 test files
- **Total Test Cases**: 30+
- **Total Assertions**: 170+
- **Coverage Threshold**: 50% (branches, functions, lines, statements)

### Test Types
1. **Unit Tests**: Model validation and methods
2. **Integration Tests**: API endpoints with authentication
3. **Component Tests**: React component rendering (setup)

---

## Running Tests

### Backend
```bash
cd backend

# Run all tests with coverage
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test
npm test -- User.test.js
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

---

## Test Database Options

### Option 1: Local MongoDB (Development)
```bash
mongod  # Tests use greendye-test database
```

### Option 2: MongoDB Atlas (CI/CD)
```bash
export MONGODB_TEST_URI="mongodb+srv://..."
```

### Option 3: In-Memory (Fastest)
```bash
npm install --save-dev mongodb-memory-server
# No MongoDB installation required!
```

## Pre-Launch Checklist Update

### Before Testing Implementation
```
Testing:
- [ ] Unit tests written
- [ ] Integration tests passed
- [ ] Payment gateways tested (test mode)
- [ ] Email notifications tested
- [ ] Load testing completed
```

### After Testing Implementation
```
Testing:
- [x] Unit tests written (models)
- [x] Integration tests written (API endpoints)
- [x] Test infrastructure setup (Jest, coverage)
- [x] Test utilities and helpers created
- [ ] Payment gateways tested (requires live API keys)
- [ ] Email notifications tested (requires SMTP server)
- [ ] Load testing (requires production environment)
```

## What's NOT Included (By Design)

These require external services and are beyond basic testing infrastructure:

1. **Payment Gateway Testing**: Requires live API keys and test accounts
   - Stripe test mode
   - PayPal sandbox
   - Fawry test environment
   - Paymob test credentials

2. **Email Testing**: Requires SMTP server configuration
   - Notification emails
   - Password reset emails
   - Welcome emails

3. **Load Testing**: Requires production-like environment
   - Artillery or k6 setup
   - Large dataset generation
   - Performance benchmarking

4. **E2E Testing**: Requires browser automation setup
   - Cypress installation
   - Test scenarios
   - Visual regression testing

These can be added later as needed based on deployment requirements.
